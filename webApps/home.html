Introduction
<p />
Linington Nature Reserve is a local nature park located on the edge of Stourville, cultivated to encourage and sustain a diversity of wildlife. Our reserve is regularly used by both local schools and birdwatchers, and can accomodate both casual walkers and more dedicated wildlife researchers. 
<p />
The Reserve offers an exciting environmental display and an excellent schools service, including an onsite laboratory from which binoculars and microscopes can be used by pupils. See the <a href = "www.google.com">school trips section</a> for more details.
<p />
We also offer special <a href = "www.google.com">workshops</a> on topics such as "Making a Wildlife Garden" and "Digital Wildlife Photography", for which a charge is made. Booking is essential - places are limited!
<p />
We hope you enjoy your time at Linington.
