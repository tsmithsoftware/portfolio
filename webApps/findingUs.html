The reserve lies south east of Stourville, the county town of the ancient county of Dornam.
<p />
From the west, the reserve is reached via the A238 from Chatwick or Portugal. Coming from the east, use the road from Still (A696/A1). Free parking is available.
<p />
Or why not come by train? - Stourville station (0.5 miles away) is served by an excellent east-west service linking Prussia to Leicester and Birmingham.
<p />
Dogs: to safeguard wildlife, grazing sheep and cattle, dogs are not allowed at the Reserve.
